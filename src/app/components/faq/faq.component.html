                                        automatically replicated to other cloud vendor and made available in that cloud. This capability will be expanded significantly in 2018.

                                    The meaning in Sanskrit of Maya is typically translated as magic. And in Hindu Vedic writings, Maya often denotes wisdom or power. In our case, we chose the word Maya because we think that only a set of software and underlying software as a service solutions
                                    as powerful as MayaOnline and OpenEBS working together to extend Kubernetes can finally address the challenges of cloud lock-in and of managing storage and data services for today’s ever more dynamic and complex microservices
                                    and containerized environments; making easy the managing of disparate workloads across disparate clouds, as well as on-premises, for optimization and the managing of cloud lock-in is “magic”. Also, as a global company,
                                    we are very proud of our roots in Bangalore and of the tremendous support Indian open source communities give us.

                                    This is an excellent question. Security should be multi-layered of course. In the case of MayaOnline that security begins with OpenEBS itself being built to be secure, with at rest and in flight encryption; this encryption helps to secure the data and
                                    is unique for an open source containerized storage solution. The control plane is then secured through the use of SSL between OpenEBS and MayaOnline. A variety of additional security capabilities are being added to
                                    both OpenEBS and MayaOnline before release for general commercial availability, including integration with more enterprise access control systems and role based access control.

                                    In addition, both OpenEBS and MayaOnline are built and updated via an automated approach that constantly scans for vulnerabilities; once identified in the upstream, such as in underlying packages, these vulnerabilities are fixed as a part of the build
                                    and test process.

                                    invoking unique storage policies. MayaOnline simplifies that management of fleets of OpenEBS systems and extends them via capabilities such as cross-cloud replication, analytics, and ChatOps; all of these capabilities
                                    benefit by being run in the cloud as SaaS.</p>

                                    Today MayaOnline’s ChatOps only integrates with Slack. Slack has a well formed and broadly adopted method for integrations and is by far the most widely used chat for ChatOps.

                                    However, we are using an abstraction layer based on a leading open source bot framework called botman. This will allow MayaOnline to work with all leading chat projects. Each user will have a dedicated chatbot at MayaOnline, and will cover the basic data
                                    operational management flow through the bot. Users can query the status and history of any component of OpenEBS clusters across the clouds. Similarly, smart alerts are delivered to Slack and seek an interactive response
                                    to manage the alerting situation.

                                    Our design is to keep the business logic for communications and for any automations invoked by MayaOnline and confirmed by ChatOps within MayaOnline and not in the bot; we also adhere to infrastructure as code in our architecture. For example, if a user
                                    invokes additional replication via MayaOnline, this means that one or more OpenEBS instances need to perform this replication. MayaOnline then makes the equivalent of a pull request to an underlying repository tracking
                                    storage policies for the OpenEBS instance in question.

                                    MayaOnline includes initial cMotion capabilities. These rely upon the power of individual OpenEBS containers which - if they are using the new cStore storage engine - have the ability to deliver copy on write based snapshots. These snapshots - and the
                                    approach to writing data to disk itself - are inherently safer and more efficient than many other approaches to replication. When used for replication, this approach means that only changes to the underlying data are
                                    sent across the network to the far end. The entire experience of moving the OpenEBS data containers across user’s Kubernetes clusters is seamlessly handled by MayaOnline.

                                    In short, no. However there will likely at least be a community supported approach to this as we have heard the request many times. Maya itself is using Prometheus, as stated above, so that piece is straight-forward; on the other hand, actually being
                                    able customize storage policies per workload and the ability to move those workloads - and their storage policies - across clouds is perhaps only currently possible for PODs where OpenEBS is providing the storage. Please
                                    join us on the OpenEBS slack channel and let us know your thoughts.

                                    We are listening closely to user feedback. You can expect progress along the following dimensions: analytics, chatops, cross cloud workload management and various capabilities that might be called “enterprise capabilities” such as LDAP integration and
                                    improved role based access controls.

                                    One interesting set of capabilities under development enables the use of information from our analytics and other sources of information to suggest changes to storage policies; for example, a user might be able to request that MayaOnline suggest changes
                                    to underlying storage policies anytime the observed usage by a set of users of a particular cloud crosses a certain threshold.

                                    We also have some work to do to insure that MayaOnline supports infrastructure as code. In the near future, the configuration of your services on MayaOnline will be available as a simple YAML file, much as storage policies are stored in Kubernetes environments.
                                    Additionally, we are looking at having any configuration changes suggested by MayaOnline be sent as a PR to your underlying git repository.
